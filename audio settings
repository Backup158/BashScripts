In pavucontrol, switch to the "Playback" tab. On the right of a sound source, you can select to which output device its sound will go. 
    standard audio output device if you want to hear the sound, but don't want to stream it. 
    Null Output if you want to stream it, but don't want to hear it 
    Simultaneous output (combine output) if you want to hear it AND stream it.
